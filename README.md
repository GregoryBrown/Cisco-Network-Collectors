# Cisco-Network-Collectors
The goal of the application is to be a unified collection system of all the different technologies that are able to monitor Cisco IOS XR devices.  The application will export the desired metrics into a TSDB, to be queried and displayed.  This application will also allow the triggering of notifications based on alerts in the metrics
